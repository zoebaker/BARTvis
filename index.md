## Welcome to BARTvis 

My name is Zoe Baker and I'll be posting assignments related to my final project for my data visualization course. 

### Project Background 
  As a lifelong rider of Bay Area public transportation, I have found the changes to BART and MUNI during the pandemic very interesting. Although San Franisco has moved into the orange tier, I do not ride public transportation nearly as much as I used to. I am curious to see how public transportation ridership has or has not gone back to normal as some people like me choose to not ride, and others have no choice.  

  Iâ€™ve also been learning more about the origins of BART and how it destroyed Black and Brown neighborhoods in order for the service to bring white middle class workers who were leaving the city for more suburban areas to their jobs in the Financial District. Transportation and mobility are incredibly important aspects of racial equity and I think the data could reveal information about essential workers, patterns of gentrification, and how public transportation has or has not changed due to the pandemic.
