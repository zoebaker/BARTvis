## Welcome to BARTvis 

My name is Zoe and I'll be posting assignments related to my final project for my data visualization course. 

### Project Background 
  As a lifelong rider of Bay Area public transportation, I have found the changes to BART and MUNI during the pandemic very interesting. Although San Franisco has moved into the orange tier, I do not ride public transportation nearly as much as I used to. I am curious to see how public transportation ridership has or has not gone back to normal as some people like me choose to not ride, and others have no choice.  

  Iâ€™ve also been learning more about the origins of BART and how it destroyed Black and Brown neighborhoods in order for the service to bring white middle class workers who were leaving the city for more suburban areas to their jobs in the Financial District. Transportation and mobility are incredibly important aspects of racial equity and I think the data could reveal information about essential workers, patterns of gentrification, and how public transportation has or has not changed due to the pandemic.  


### Data Definitions and Processing
All data was gathered from the [Kaggle BART ridership datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/mrgeislinger/bart-ridership). For the histogram and parallel coordinate charts, data was aggregated using the below definitions of time periods based on Bay Area shelter in place and stay at home orders.A note about this, California and the Bay Area went back into shelter in place on Dec 6, 2020, however this period is included in the after because this study focuses on the initial shelter in place. Additionally, the 'after lockdown' period goes until April 2nd, because that is the last time this data was pulled. For more information on major moments in the Bay Area during the COVID-19 pandemic, go to this [link](https://abc7news.com/timeline-of-coronavirus-us-covid-19-bay-area-sf/6047519/).  

- Before the Lockdown: April 1st 2019-March 16th, 2020
- During the Lockdown:March 17th-May 4th
- After the Lockdown: May 5th - April 2nd

** *The dates for before the lockdown were chosen to have a similar amount of months as the after lockdown period for comparison's sake.*
